# Recurrent-Knowledge-Graph-Embedding
This is the code of a knowledge graph embedding framework – RKGE – with a novel recurrent network architecture for high-quality recommendation. RKGE not only learns the semantic representation of different types of entities but also automatically captures entity relations encoded in KGs.

#### Pre-requisits
- We adopt two real-world datasets - MovieLens and Yelp. For the MoiveLens dataset, we crawl the corresponding IMDB dataset as movie auxiliary information, including genre, director, and actor.
